"""`DSPGPEmulator` — gpjax-backed dimension-scaled-prior GP emulator.

Implements the Hvarfner et al. (2024) recipe:

  *Vanilla Bayesian Optimization Performs Great in High Dimensions*,
  ICML 2024. https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02229

Key idea: keep vanilla GP-BO, but tighten the kernel/likelihood priors
and **scale the lengthscale prior with the input dimension**:

- Lengthscale: ``LogNormal(loc = √2 + 0.5·log(d), scale = √3)`` (ARD)
- Outputscale: fixed at 1.0 (no `ScaleKernel` wrapper)
- Noise: ``LogNormal(loc = -4.0, scale = 1.0)`` on the **standard
  deviation** — gpjax exposes ``obs_stddev`` rather than variance.
  Tracked separately from the GPyTorch reference, which puts the same
  prior on the variance parameter.
- Lengthscale floor: 2.5e-2; noise floor: 1e-4. Both initialized at
  the prior modes.

Inference: MAP — minimize ``-(conjugate_mll + Σ log_prior)``.

Assumptions (caller's responsibility):
- Inputs are normalized to ``[0, 1]^d``.
- Outputs are standardized to zero-mean unit-variance.

Both are implicit in the ``outputscale = 1`` choice. Violating either
will degrade the prior's calibration.
